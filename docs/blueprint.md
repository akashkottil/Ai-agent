- Chat Interface: Display the conversation history in a clean, easy-to-read chat interface.
- Chat Reset: Enable users to clear the conversation history.
- Message input: Implement an interactive message box, in order to enter new text

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#778899) to give the interface a calm, professional feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF), a very desaturated version of the primary, to provide a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA), an analogous color used for interactive elements like the submit button and active role selections, providing a gentle contrast.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern and neutral appearance in both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist, professional icons to represent different bot roles, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
- Design a clean, single-column layout for the chat interface, making it easy to follow the conversation flow.
- Incorporate subtle fade-in animations for new messages, creating a smooth and engaging user experience.
